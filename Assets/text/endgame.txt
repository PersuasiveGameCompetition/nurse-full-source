Every day, nurses experience similar stress, anxiety and emotional trauma. They are expected to deal with these experiences effectively while delivering high quality care. They are expected to carry out their daily tasks and go beyond the call of duty to help others. Additionally, nurses carry enormous responsibility for their patients, and their every mistake is harshly critisized by hospital administration and the media. This makes the nursing profession a highly demanding and exhausting profession, putting them in a very vulnerable position. 

When mistakes are made, or when patients make complaints, nurses are often blamed and punished.
