You continue down the corridor. 

'Nurse!'

You turn around to see that one of the other nurses has called you from inside a patient's room. She's standing by the bed of an elderly obese man. 

'Please, can you come help me lift this patient? He's got bad bed sores and we need to make sure that he shifts his position on the bed so that the sores don't get any worse.'

The elderly man moans, his expression full of pain. It is clear that he is too heavy for the other nurse to lift alone.  

Will you help with lifting the patient or continue to find the medicines your patient needs?
