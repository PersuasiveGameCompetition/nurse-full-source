'I'll help.' 

The nurse gives you an appreciative glance, saying:
'I recently hurt my back lifting heavy patients. It's so nice of you to stay and help.'

As you lift the man, allowing him to lie on his side, his pained expression softens and he mutters a quiet thanks. 

You feel so glad to have stayed and helped, but now you must continue on your way.
