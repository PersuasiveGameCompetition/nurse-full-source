You continue down the corridor. As you walk along, you see an elderly lady patient wandering about. 

You hear her muttering as you walk closer to her: 
'Oh dear... Where am I? I can't seem to find my way back to my room...'

You realise that it's the elderly lady with dementia from the floor above who was recently admitted due to a bad fall. 

The elderly lady looks up at you, saying:

'Can you help me? I'm trying to find my way back... but I'm not sure which direction I came from... Where am I?'

She glances up and down the corridor, her face lined with confusion and anxiety. 

As you approach her, a strong smell overwhelms you. 

She has soiled herself. She needs your help.
