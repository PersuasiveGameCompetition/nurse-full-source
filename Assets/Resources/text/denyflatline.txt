You can't stay. Your own patient is in desperate need of these medicines. 

You force yourself to turn away from the dying patient, and continue down the corridor.

You desperately hope other staff members will soon rush over to help save this patient. 

You feel so guilty for leaving, but you need to hurry up. 

As you run towards the last medicine, you continue to hear the loud, piercing sound from the heart monitor, haunting your every step.
